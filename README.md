# Elanco Population App

## Overview

The Elanco Population App is a React-based web application that retrieves and displays population data for cities and countries using REST APIs. It provides stakeholders with an easy-to-use interface to explore and visualize population statistics.

This project was developed as part of the Software Engineers â€“ Second Interview Assignment for Elanco, demonstrating technical and problem-solving skills.

## Development Stages

1. **Problem Understanding**  
The stakeholders needed a web app to display country and population data.

   **Key requirements**:
   - Consume REST APIs to fetch data.
   - Display the data in a visual and interactive format.
   - Provide a user-friendly experience.

2. **API Integration**  
   Implemented API calls using Axios:
   - `getPopulationData`: Fetches population data for cities.
   - `getCountryFlags`: Retrieves flag images for countries.

3. **Component Development**  
   **CountryList Component**:
   - Displays countries, cities, and populations in a list format.
   - Includes a search bar for filtering results dynamically.  
   **PopulationChart Component**:
   - Uses Chart.js to render an interactive bar chart.
   - Dynamically updates based on user-selected data.

4. **Interactive Design**  
   - Added a sticky chart to enhance usability.
   - Used Tailwind CSS for a clean and consistent design.

5. **Enhancements**  
   - Added API error handling to gracefully manage issues.
   - Focused on modular and reusable components.
